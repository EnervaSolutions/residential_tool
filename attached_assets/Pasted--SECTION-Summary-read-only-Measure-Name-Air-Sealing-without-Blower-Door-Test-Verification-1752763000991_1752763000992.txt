🔹 SECTION: Measure Overview

- Measure Description: Air Sealing without Blower Door Test
- Base Case: Standard house with an average infiltration rate of 1.5 air changes per hour and natural gas heating with AFUE of 85%
- Efficient Case: 10% reduction in infiltration rate
- Source of Energy Savings Estimates: Wisconsin Focus on Energy, 2020 Technical Reference Manual, pg 848

- Energy Savings Calculation Approach:
Energy Savings = [1.08 × VolumeRateofInfiltrationbyAir × (ThermostatSetPointTemp – OutsideTemp) / (HeatingSystemEfficiency × BTUtoThermsConversion)]
× AnnualHourswhereOutsideTemperatureisbelowThermostatSetPointTemperature
× SavingsFraction
× ThermstoGJconversion
