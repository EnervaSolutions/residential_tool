We just need calculators for seventeen technologies, ill provide them to u one at a time. Here is the first one:

Technology name: Window Replacement

Category: Fenestration
Lifetime: 20 Source: Iowa Energy Efficiency Statewide Technical Reference Manual â€“ Volume 2: Residential Measures

ðŸ”¹ SECTION: Measure Overview (text blocks)

Measure Description: Installing triple pane windows with a USI value of 1.22, instead of windows with a USI value of 2.
Base Case: New window with U value of 2.0
Efficient Case: New window with U value of 1.22
Source of Energy Savings Estimates: Iowa TRM, version 5, volume 2, 2.6.8 Efficient Windows - Page 314
Energy Savings Calculation Approach: Heating Savings = ((Ubaseline - Uupgrade) * AreaWindow * HDD * 24 * ADJwindow * ConversionfromkWhtoGJ * ConversionfromWhtokWh)) / EfficiencyofHeatingSystem Cooling Savings = ((Ubaseline - Uupgrade) * AreaWindow * CDD * 24 * ADJwindow * ConversionfromkWhtoGJ * ConversionfromWhtokWh)) / (Conversion from BtutokBtu * EfficiencyofCoolingSystem)
