ðŸ”¹ SECTION: Measure Overview

- Measure Description: Installing a drain water heat recovery system in a house with an electric storage water heater
- Base Case: Standard water heater with drain water with the incoming water temperature of 46.04 Â°F and leaving water of 101 Â°F
- Efficient Case: Drain water heat recovery system with recovery efficiency greater than 25%
- Electric Water Heater Efficiency: = 'Common Values'!C10
- Source of Energy Savings Estimates: Iowa TRM, vol 3, August 30, 2019, 3.2.6. Drainwater Heat Recovery - Page 65

- Energy Savings Calculation Approach:
Savings = ((Tout - Tin) Ã— AnnualHotWaterUse Ã— SpecificWeightWater Ã— SpecificHeatWater Ã— PracticalEffectiveness Ã— BTUtoTherm) Ã· RecoveryEfficiency Ã— ThermtoGJ
