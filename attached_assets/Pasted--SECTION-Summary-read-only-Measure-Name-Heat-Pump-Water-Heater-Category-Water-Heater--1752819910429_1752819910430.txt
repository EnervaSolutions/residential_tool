🔹 SECTION: Calculation Values

| Variable | Field Type | Default Value | Units | Source |
|----------|------------|----------------|-------|--------|
| kBTU_req (Required annual heating output of DHW system) | calculated (locked) | = (GPD × Density × SH × TempRise × 365) / 1000 | kBTU/year | Formula-based |
| Gallons Used per Day (GPD) | number | 19.81 | gallons | NRCan |
| Density of water | number | 8.33 | lb/gallon | Constant |
| Specific heat of water | number | 1 | BTU/lb·°F | Constant |
| WaterTempRise | calculated (locked) | = ExitTemp - InletTemp | °F | Difference between delivery and setpoint |
| Water Temperature into Tank | number | 46.04 | °F | Edmonton Water Report |
| Water Temperature Exit from Tank | number | 140 | °F | National Plumbing Code |
| Conversion Factor from kWh to GJ | number | 0.0036 | — | Constant |
| Energy Factor of Heat Pump (EFee) | number | 2 | — | Mid Atlantic TRM |
| Energy Factor of Electric Water Heater (EFbase) | number | 0.9 | — | 'Common Values'!C10 |

💡 Notes:
- Inputs referencing Common Values (e.g. EFbase) must default accordingly.
- Lock calculated values in "Calculation Values" — user should not be able to edit them directly.
- Use tooltips to show sources next to field labels.
- Keep the section order: Summary, Measure Overview, Calculation Values, Outputs.
