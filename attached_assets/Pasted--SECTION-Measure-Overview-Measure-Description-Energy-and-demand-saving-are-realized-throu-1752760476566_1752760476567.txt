🔹 SECTION: Measure Overview

- Measure Description: Energy and demand saving are realized through reductions in the building cooling and heating loads.
- Base Case Description: Doors with area of 2m² and with R-Value of 2.839
- Efficient Case Description: Doors with area of 2m² with R-Value of 4.76
- Source of Heating and Cooling Energy Savings Estimates: Iowa TRM 2021 Vol. 2: Residential Measures, v.5, 2.6.5 and ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook

- Heating Energy Savings Estimates (kWh):  
((1/C20 - 1/C21) * C23 * C24 * 24) / (3412 * C26)
